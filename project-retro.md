# Project Retrospective

Letâ€™s take a few minutes as a class and capture as many insights possible in the categories below.  One of the instructional team will go through each category and capture as many thoughts as possible.  We ask that you come off mute and speak your thoughts out loud for everyone to hear. 

## Lessons Learned

What lessons did you learn during this project and how will you apply them towards the next project? 

- far more comfortable with a lot of the syntax (and new syntax) for HTML and CSS
- even with a time/priority matrix in front of you, it is easy to get carried away on one aspect of an entire project
- a project will never truly be 'complete' - it just has future updates/iterations to make things better, so don't strive for perfection, instead focus on the progress
- don't get attached to your code! Code is just code. If an idea/process didn't go quite the way you thought it would even after some tweaks, reframe in the general context of the timeline you're given for delivering a MVP
- structure is important - we had to have our own structure working on an independent project, keeping regular breaks and going outside when you have 'coders block' was incredibly useful
- just because a technology can be useful, learning it for what you are trying to do can pose to be more of a time sink than it is actually worth - I really enjoyed what Bootstrap is capable of doing, but I spent far too much time trying to make it work and eventually scrapped its integration entirely
- got to really learn what aspects of code I enjoy more than others, and that really comes with working on projects beyond just lectures and labs in class
- the power of utilizing different resources - if you cannot remember something lookit up immediately
- utilizing how to properly Google something
- do not be afraid to ask for help especially when the help is already in front of you like our program, I had several useful conversations with all the issue tickets I submitted this week


## Problem Areas

What areas of the project did you struggle with most?

- endless issues with flexbox, I understand more but still cannot get my desired result yet
- big issues with Bootstrap despite confirming I am reading the documentation correctly with an instructor - this was my biggest time sink of the entire project and ended up having to scrap its integration all together
- responsive design. I do not naturally think in a mobile design as I almost never look at websites on my phone, just smart phone apps. I naturally have a desktop first design in mind, this was very time consuming to do a mobile first approach despite it being an industry best practice now
- having elements change the correct way in CSS; a lot of the time I was not grabbing an element to modify the right way, but this got much easier and became FAR better at doing this through the project
- a good amount of impostor syndrome, had to continually remind myself that I am at the beginning of learning this entire new skillset with having zero coding experience before the program


## Future Directions

What plans do you have in the future for this project? Are there any PostMVP's that you are looking to implement and what are they? 

- have the Navbar actually work the way I want it to and with proper orientation as well
- have it so when I click the elements in the Navbar it smoothly scrolls to that part of the page - did a good amount of research but everything I tried did not work
- image carousel for all designs in the project section, trying to learn how to do it was going to be too much time
- anchor element on page for tapping/clicking on it scrolls user back to the top of the page, and the other is a contact anchor so when a potential employer makes a decision that they might want to contact me they have already seen a method to do so the entire time on the page
- having a user-specific API (I'd like a current time and/or weather nestled in the top corner somewhere)
- having the Navbar stay on the screen despite how much you scroll, and when it hits a certain section of the page, all the elements go away in the Navbar and it just has one element being what section you're on currently
- a form section in the contact section for submitting an e-mail

## Accomplishments

What do you feel most accomplished about? 

- successfuly deployed a website that satisfies all the requirements of a MVP
- being far more comfortable with a good amount of syntax for HTML/CSS
- feeling more confident at reading documentation when researching methods of doing code
- realizing what ideas were time sinks in relation to actually getting a MVP completed and being comfortable with scrapping its integration and understanding if I want that functionality that is extra, I can do it in future iterations of the website
- realizing that in reality I have learned a great deal for a whole new skillset in a short period of time
- being able to 'fluently' convey problems I am having to other developers and have them understand what exactly my issues are so the help is more direct
- conquering a lot of impostor syndrome in the past week which will always be a work in progress despite how far along we may be in our careers
