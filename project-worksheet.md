# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Complete
|Day 2| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | Complete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 5| Final Touches | Incomplete
|Day 6| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

This project is my professional portfolio website. The intentions for this project will be to establish an online portal to my personal brand being a new SWE out of the GA SEI, showcasing my skills acquired and embellished during the program, displaying projects worked on to demonstrate different competencies, and to provide a unique, enjoyable end-user experience for potential future employers who will review my portfolio. This will be created with a focus on mobile first design, incorporating HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and other potentially beneficial technologies to execute the vision to the finalized product. This project will satisfy all the necessary deliverables, with extra enhancements beyond the necessary deliverables to occur if time allows in the alloted time frame and/or after that time to continually update the space.

## Wireframes

Include images of wireframe with a description of the specific wireframe.

Wireframes were compiled utilizing Figma. The links below reference the entire wireframe for Mobile and Desktop:

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Link](https://res.cloudinary.com/jkeohan/image/upload/a_270/v1591621734/project1_matrix_ocy5gc_h1kg0m.jpg)

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Hamburger | M | 2hr | hr |
| Base HTML Done | H | 3hr | hr |
| Base CSS Done | H | 3hr |  hr |
| Regular Nav | H | 1.5hr | hr |  
| Adding Form | H | 1hr|  hr | 
| Other sections and flex | H | 3hr | hr|
| Working with API | H | 3hrs|  hr | 
| Responsive | H | 3hr | hr | hr |
| Social Media Icons | L | 1hr |  hr |
| Mobile View | H | 3hr |  hr |
| Desktop View | H | 3hr |  hr |
| Animations for Both Views | H | 3hr |  hr |
| Total | H | 29.5hrs| hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Hover for Relevent Elements | L | 2hr | hr | hr |
| API for Welcoming User Based on Location & Time | L | 1.5hr | hr |
| More Intensive Animations (color changes/transitions) | L | 3hr | hr |
| Total | H | 5.5hrs| hrs |
